Some features and functionality in the previous Video Codec SDK versions will
be deprecated in future. We encourage all users of the SDK to take a note of
this.

1. Video SDK 8.1 replaces the sample applications with applications based only
   new reusable/modular classes. The older SDK sample applications in folder
   .\LegacySamples, although included in the SDK for reference, will be 
   removed in the future SDK versions.
2. CUvideosource and the associated APIs including cuvidCreateVideoSource,
   cuvidCreateVideoSourceW, cuvidDestroyVideoSource, cuvidSetVideoSourceState,
   cuvidGetVideoSourceState, cuvidGetSourceVideoFormat, 
   cuvidGetSourceAudioFormat will be removed from the decoder API in future
   SDK versions. Please note that the new decode sample applications in the 
   SDK do not use these APIs, but instead use FFmpeg demultiplexer and parser.
3. The older API headers for NVDECODE API that supported run-time dynamic
   linking have been replaced with headers that allow load-time dynamic linking
   only. The new SDK sample applications demonstrate load-time linking using
   the new headers.
4. Support for Video Codec SDK 4.0 and earlier will be deprecated in the drivers
   releasing around Q4 2018. As a result, any application compiled with Video 
   Codec SDK 4.0 or below header(s) will stop working after those drivers. 
   Hence it is strongly recommended for users to migrate to later versions of 
   Video Codec SDK.
