What's new in Video Codec SDK 8.1:
----------------------------------
In NVIDIA Video Codec SDK release 8.1, following features have been added:

1) Older sample applications have been replaced with new sample applications built on re-usable classes. The clients can re-use the base classes to develop their own applications for doing encoding, decoding and transcoding. Most of the programming of the NVENCODEAPI and NVDECODEAPI is done inside the base classes which makes NVENCODE API and NVDECODE API easy to use.
2) Capability to use B frames as reference during encoding has been exposed.  
3) Encoding emphasis map. 
4) Capbility to query residual encode capacity on managed(vGPU) platforms for windows. 

What's new in Video Codec SDK 8.0:
----------------------------------
In NVIDIA Video Codec SDK release 8.0, following features have been added:

Encode Features 
-----------------
1) Encoding support for OGL surfaces (Linux only)
2) Improved quality for HEVC spatial adaptive quantization
3) Weighted prediction
4) External motion hints for H.264 motion estimation (ME) only mode
5) Support for fractional values in target quality rate control mode 


Decode Features 
-----------------
1) HEVC 10 bit decoding
2) HEVC 12 bit decoding
3) VP9 10 bit decoding
4) VP9 12 bit decoding
5) Decode capability API
6) Decode latency reduction 
7) Memory optimization for I/IDR-frame only decoding
